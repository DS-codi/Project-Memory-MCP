# Only fail audits on high/critical severity.
# The remaining moderate vulnerabilities are all in devDependencies (eslint's ajv@6 chain).
# These cannot be fixed upstream until eslint ships ajv@8 support (tracked: eslint#20508).
# Production dependencies have zero vulnerabilities (confirmed via: npm audit --omit=dev).
