  "description": "Interactive terminal system with a native Rust+QML GUI app that provides approve/decline command execution flow. The GUI spawns on the host machine, communicates with the MCP server (local or container) via TCP loopback, shows commands for approval, and returns results (including decline reasons) back to the agent. Four child plans: (1) GUI app, (2) MCP/extension/container integration, (3) agent/instructions/skills updates, (4) filesystem tool audit and completion.",
