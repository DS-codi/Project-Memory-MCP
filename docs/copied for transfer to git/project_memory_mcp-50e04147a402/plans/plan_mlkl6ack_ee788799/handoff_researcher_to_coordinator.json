    "research_summary": "Audited all 6 target areas: run-container.ps1, podman-compose.yml, entrypoint.sh, Containerfile, server transport (http-transport.ts + container-proxy.ts), extension connection flow (ContainerDetection.ts + ServerManager.ts + McpBridge.ts). Key findings: /health endpoint already exists, container health monitor already exists in ServerManager (30s poll, auto-fallback to local), container-proxy.ts has session resilience with auto-reconnect. Main gaps: no hot-add mounts, no graceful state flush, no reconnect-to-container after recovery, no startup readiness check, no standalone ContainerHealthService. Detailed insertion points documented for all 9 implementation steps."
