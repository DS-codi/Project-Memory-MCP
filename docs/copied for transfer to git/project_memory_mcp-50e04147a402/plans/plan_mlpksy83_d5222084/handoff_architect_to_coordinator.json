Key architectural change: transparent session detection via _session_id meta-field eliminates tool schema changes (removed 7 file modifications). Ready for Executor implementation.",

    "plan_changes": "Rewrote all 34 steps into 26 concrete steps across 7 phases. Eliminated 8 steps by: (1) removing tool handler/schema modifications (transparent _session_id approach), (2) consolidating small steps, (3) merging Phases 3-5 into one interception phase. Every step now has exact function signatures, file paths, patterns, and acceptance criteria. No RESEARCH NEEDED markers remain."
