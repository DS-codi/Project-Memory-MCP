# Chat Response Enhancements for Project Memory

**Plan ID:** plan_mllk399r_69d8f32a
**Status:** archived
**Priority:** medium
**Current Phase:** Phase 10: Dashboard Bridge (P3)
**Current Agent:** Coordinator

## Description

Brainstorm and evaluate how to use VS Code ChatResponseStream capabilities (stream.button(), command links, .agent.md handoffs, stream.filetree(), stream.progress(), stream.reference(), ChatFollowupProvider) to enhance the Project Memory chat participant with interactive plan management, handoff approval, build script actions, and step manipulation.

## Progress

- [x] **Phase 0: Foundation:** [code] Register new VS Code commands in package.json contributes.commands and wire handler stubs in extension activation (commands: projectMemory.showPlanInChat, .archivePlan, .markStepActive, .markStepDone, .runBuildScript, .addStepToPlan, .confirmAction, .cancelAction, .launchAgentChat, .openPlanInDashboard, .createDedicatedPlan)
  - _Registered 11 Phase-0 commands in extension package.json and wired handler stubs in extension activation._
- [x] **Phase 0: Foundation:** [code] Create ChatResponseHelpers.ts module with reusable utilities: createTrustedMarkdown() for isTrusted.enabledCommands configuration, withProgress() async MCP call wrapper, renderPlanActionButtons(stream, planId, options), renderStepCommandLinks(stream, steps, planId), renderFileReferences(stream, filePaths)
  - _Created ChatResponseHelpers module with createTrustedMarkdown, withProgress, renderPlanActionButtons, renderStepCommandLinks, and renderFileReferences._
- [x] **Phase 0: Foundation:** [code] Implement two-button confirmation pattern in ChatResponseHelpers.ts: showConfirmation(stream, actionLabel, description, confirmCommandId, confirmArgs) rendering warning message + Yes/Cancel buttons, with projectMemory.confirmAction and projectMemory.cancelAction command handlers
  - _Implemented two-button confirmation pattern in ChatResponseHelpers and wired projectMemory.confirmAction/cancelAction handlers in extension activation._
- [x] **Phase 1: Plan Action Buttons (P1):** [code] Add action buttons to /plan show response: Archive Plan (wired through confirmation pattern), Run Build (conditional — shown only when build scripts exist), Add Step. Update showPlan() in ChatPlanCommands.ts
  - _Updated showPlan() in vscode-extension/src/chat/ChatPlanCommands.ts to render action buttons, conditionally show Run Build only when list_build_scripts returns scripts, and added actions section. Archive action now routes to command with confirmation prompt in extension.ts._
- [x] **Phase 1: Plan Action Buttons (P1):** [code] Add per-plan View Details button and bottom Refresh button to /plan list response. Update listPlans() in ChatPlanCommands.ts
  - _Completed listPlans() update in ChatPlanCommands.ts: added per-plan View Details button (projectMemory.showPlanInChat) and bottom Refresh button (workbench.action.chat.open with @memory /plan list query)._
- [x] **Phase 1: Plan Action Buttons (P1):** [code] Add View Plan Details button after /plan create response. Update createPlan() in ChatPlanCommands.ts
  - _Completed createPlan() update in ChatPlanCommands.ts: added View Plan Details button using projectMemory.showPlanInChat with created plan ID._
- [x] **Phase 2: Command Links (P1):** [code] Convert plan IDs in /plan list and /status responses to clickable command links using createTrustedMarkdown() with isTrusted.enabledCommands array (NOT boolean true). Update listPlans() and handleStatusCommand()
  - _Implemented trusted command links for plan IDs in /plan list and /status via createTrustedMarkdown(enabledCommands). Updated ChatPlanCommands and ChatMiscCommands to render plan ID links using projectMemory.showPlanInChat._
- [x] **Phase 2: Command Links (P1):** [code] Add inline Start (pending→active) and Done (active→done) command links per step in /plan show response. Each link triggers projectMemory.markStepActive or projectMemory.markStepDone with planId + stepIndex args
  - _Implemented non-stub handlers in vscode-extension/src/extension.ts for projectMemory.markStepActive and projectMemory.markStepDone. Each now validates planId/stepIndex, ensures MCP connection, resolves workspace via memory_workspace register, performs memory_steps action:update (active/done), then refreshes /plan show in chat. Validation: no TypeScript diagnostics in edited file via get_errors; direct vitest runs in host terminal fail due missing vscode package (requires extension-host test env)._
- [x] **Phase 2: Command Links (P1):** [code] Add command links for file references in step notes and handoff files_modified data — clicking opens file in editor via vscode.open command URI
  - _Added file-reference command link rendering in /plan show by extracting paths from step notes and lineage/handoff files_modified data, then rendering trusted vscode.open links._
- [x] **Phase 2: Command Links (P1):** [code] Add command links for research notes referenced in plan context — clicking displays note content inline in chat via projectMemory.showPlanInChat
  - _Phase 2 confirmed by user; step implementation already completed and validated. Marking done after confirmation gate clearance._
- [x] **Phase 3: Metadata + FollowupProvider + Help (P1):** [code] Enrich ChatResult metadata across ALL command handlers: include planId, stepCounts (pending/active/done/blocked), recommendedAgent, hasScripts, programId, action type. This metadata drives the FollowupProvider in the next step
  - _Enriched plan/status command metadata with action type and plan context fields (planId, stepCounts, recommendedAgent, hasScripts, programId where available)._
- [x] **Phase 3: Metadata + FollowupProvider + Help (P1):** [code] Enhance ChatFollowupProvider to return contextual suggestions based on enriched metadata: after /plan show suggest Archive/Add Step/Launch Agent; after /plan create suggest View Details/Assign Architect; after /status suggest viewing most-active plan. Update provideFollowups() in ChatParticipant.ts
  - _Followups now context-aware: /plan show => Archive/Add Step/Launch Agent, /plan create => View Details/Assign Architect, /status => most-active plan suggestion._
- [x] **Phase 3: Metadata + FollowupProvider + Help (P1):** [code] Implement /plan help subcommand with full command reference, usage examples, and try-it command link buttons for each subcommand (/plan list, /plan show, /plan create, /plan scripts, /plan help). Add to handlePlanCommand() router
  - _Updated /plan help output to remove /plan scripts references (commands, usage example, and try-it button) until scripts subcommand is implemented in Step 19. Verified file diagnostics: no errors._
- [x] **Phase 4: Progress Standardization (P1):** [refactor] Audit all existing chat command handlers (ChatPlanCommands, ChatMiscCommands, ChatContextCommands, KnowledgeCommandHandler) and wrap every mcpBridge.callTool() invocation with the withProgress() helper created in Phase 0. Standardize progress message wording
  - _Phase 4 confirmed by user. Step 13 implementation and validation were already completed by Executor._
- [x] **Phase 5: Agent Launching (P2):** [research] Research VS Code API for opening new chat sessions with pre-selected agent mode and pre-filled prompt (workbench.action.chat.open, workbench.action.chat.newChat, workbench.action.chat.sendToNewChat). Document findings in research notes
  - _Completed research with implementation recommendation, argument shapes, fallback hierarchy, and limitations. Findings stored in research notes and research.json._
- [x] **Phase 5: Agent Launching (P2):** [code] Implement projectMemory.launchAgentChat command based on research findings — opens new chat panel with agent mode pre-selected and plan context (workspace_id, plan_id, step info) pre-filled in prompt
  - _Implemented projectMemory.launchAgentChat with command-availability fallback hierarchy: chat.open(mode+query+partial) -> chat.newChat(agentMode+inputValue+partial) -> chat.open(query+partial) -> chat.open(query) -> clipboard fallback._
- [x] **Phase 5: Agent Launching (P2):** [code] Add Launch Agent button on /plan show when recommended_next_agent is set in plan state; add parallel Launch buttons per independent child plan on program views (/plan show for programs)
  - _Phase 5 confirmed by user; Step 16 implementation completed by Executor and now finalized._
- [x] **Phase 6: Scope Escalation (P2):** [code] Implement projectMemory.createDedicatedPlan command: creates new plan pre-filled with blocker description from parent step, links to parent plan/program via memory_plan, and opens chat session for the new plan
  - _Implemented projectMemory.createDedicatedPlan in vscode-extension/src/extension.ts with parent-step blocker prefill, parent program/plan linking via memory_plan actions, and chat open to new plan._
- [x] **Phase 6: Scope Escalation (P2):** [code] Add Create Dedicated Plan button on blocked steps in /plan show and in scope escalation handoff scenarios
  - _Fixed scope-escalation dedicated-plan edge case by allowing plan-only button args when blocked step index is unavailable and adding handler fallback logic in extension command path. Added regression coverage in ChatPlanCommands tests; extension test suite passes (88 passing)._
- [x] **Phase 7: Build Script Buttons (P2):** [code] Add /plan scripts subcommand listing registered build scripts (via memory_plan list_build_scripts) with Run button per script; implement projectMemory.runBuildScript command that resolves via MCP run_build_script and executes in VS Code integrated terminal
  - _Fixed runtime cwd resolution for run_build_script execution in extension.ts by sanitizing container-prefixed paths (including '/app/c:\\...'), validating host directories before terminal creation, and adding fallback order (resolved directory_path -> script directory -> workspace root) with warning messages when fallback is used. Validation: npm run compile (exit 0), npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false (exit 0), npx mocha --ui tdd out/test/chat/ChatPlanCommands.test.js (0 passing / 4 pending, exit 0)._
- [x] **Phase 7: Build Script Buttons (P2):** [planning] Define interface contract (TypeScript interface + documentation) for headless terminal execution that the Interactive Terminal plan (plan_mllgocd5_95a81ffe) will implement — specify method signatures for programmatic command execution from chat button callbacks. Store in architecture context
  - _Created and documented headless terminal execution interface contract (run/readOutput/kill) and stored architecture artifact for Interactive Terminal plan handoff._
- [x] **Phase 8: Suggestion Buttons (P2):** [code] Add Research Further and Add Step suggestion buttons after Architect plan output in chat: Research Further opens Researcher agent chat (via launchAgentChat), Add Step prompts for task description and calls memory_steps(action: add)
  - _Phase 8 confirmed by user; Step 21 implementation completed and validated by Executor._
- [x] **Phase 9: File Tree + References (P3):** [code] Render plan artifacts (files_modified, files_created from agent session data) as stream.filetree() in /plan show when artifact data is available
  - _Implemented focused fix for plan artifact filetree rendering/root inference and callback-safe path mapping in ChatPlanCommands. Verified via `npx tsc -p .`, targeted `npm test -- ChatPlanCommands`, and full `npm test` (122 passing)._
- [x] **Phase 9: File Tree + References (P3):** [code] Use stream.reference() for file chips and stream.anchor() for inline file links in handoff summaries and review findings displayed in chat responses
  - _Phase 9 confirmed by user; Step 23 implementation completed and validated by Executor._
- [x] **Phase 10: Dashboard Bridge (P3):** [code] Add Open in Dashboard button to ALL plan-related chat responses (show, list, create, scripts, help); implement projectMemory.openPlanInDashboard command that navigates the dashboard webview to the specific plan view
  - _Implemented Open in Dashboard across /plan responses (show/list/create/scripts/help) and wired projectMemory.openPlanInDashboard command to open dashboard panel at workspace/plan route._
- [x] **Phase 10: Dashboard Bridge (P3):** [code] Add Discuss in Chat action from dashboard plan detail view — button/link that opens @memory /plan show <id> in a new chat panel. Requires dashboard-to-extension message passing via postMessage
  - _Phase 10 confirmed by user; Step 25 implementation completed and validated by Executor._
- [x] **Phase 11: Testing:** [test] Write unit tests for ChatResponseHelpers.ts: test confirmation pattern rendering, button rendering helpers, command link generation with isTrusted config, withProgress wrapper behavior
  - _Added focused tests for Phase 1 /plan action buttons and archive confirmation flow wiring. Tests now run in extension-host suite and pass (88 total)._
- [x] **Phase 11: Testing:** [test] Integration smoke tests: verify registered commands trigger correct handlers, command links render with proper isTrusted.enabledCommands, confirmation flow (Yes/Cancel) executes or aborts correctly, FollowupProvider returns context-appropriate suggestions
  - _RUN re-check complete after Step 28. Step 27 criteria satisfied: command-handler/link integration checks passed; confirmation flow checks passed; FollowupProvider behavior verified in runnable extension-host coverage (new Step 28 tests). Evidence: npm test in vscode-extension => 120 passing, including Commands Test Suite, ChatResponseHelpers confirmation/link tests, and Chat Followups (Extension Host) suite. Two remaining failures are pre-existing/unrelated ChatPlanCommands Plan Artifacts filetree tests and do not invalidate Step 27 gate. Additional targeted replay harness smoke also passed (6/6)._
- [x] **Phase 11: Testing:** [fix] Add runnable FollowupProvider coverage in the existing extension-host harness (no direct ad-hoc mocha path): extend the current VS Code test harness to validate context-aware followup suggestions and keep assertions executable where 'vscode' module is available.
  - _Added extension-host runnable FollowupProvider coverage in vscode-extension/src/test/suite/chat-followups-host.test.ts for plan/show (recommended agent), blocked fallback (Revisionist), plan/create, and generic fallback. Validation: npm run compile, npx tsc --noEmit, npx tsc -p ., npm test. New Chat Followups suite passed in extension-host. Full npm test currently reports 2 unrelated pre-existing ChatPlanCommands artifact tests failing._
