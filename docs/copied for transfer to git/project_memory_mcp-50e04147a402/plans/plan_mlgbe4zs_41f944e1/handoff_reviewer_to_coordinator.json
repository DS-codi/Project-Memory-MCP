  "reason": "Review APPROVED for Phase 9: Extension Knowledge Integration. All 3 steps (25, 26, 31) correctly implemented. KnowledgeCommandHandler.ts is a clean 279-line extraction with 4 subcommands (list/show/add/delete), correct MCP action names, and thorough error handling. ChatParticipant.ts /context command now includes knowledge file summary and /context set subcommand. package.json correctly registers /knowledge. 4 minor non-blocking issues: SECTION_LABELS duplication, ChatParticipant.ts at 915 lines (pre-existing), unused VALID_CATEGORIES const, handleAdd indexOf edge case. No security concerns. Reindex delta: 0 files, 0 lines. Recommend Tester to write tests for this phase.",
