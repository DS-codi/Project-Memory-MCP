All 5 areas investigated: (1) SkillWriter current state and what needs modification vs addition, (2) instruction file formats/conventions in both .github/instructions/ and instructions/, (3) classification heuristics for rules vs skills with decision tree, (4) cross-workspace deployment model including dual-workspace pattern, (5) user confirmation flow patterns. Recommend Architect to design the solution.",
