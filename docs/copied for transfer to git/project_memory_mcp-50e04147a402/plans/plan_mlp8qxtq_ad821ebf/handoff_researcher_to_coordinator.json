Created comprehensive research notes on: (1) container-to-host launch mechanisms with 7 approaches evaluated, (2) MCP SDK timeout behavior with implementation guidance, (3) full codebase IPC audit with protocol mismatch analysis. Recommend Architect to design the solution architecture.",

      "Priority 3: Decide on container-to-host GUI launch approach (launcher shim vs. separate daemon)",

    "critical_findings": [
      "NDJSON protocol between TS and Rust is INCOMPATIBLE - field names, status values, and metadata fields all differ",
      "The existing in-process adapter is a MOCK - no real TCP client exists connecting MCP server to GUI",
      "MCP SDK progress notifications can keep tool calls alive indefinitely - 10-15s interval recommended",
      "Container cannot launch host processes - host-side launcher service is required",
      "Orchestration layer (adapter interface + lifecycle) is solid and reusable as-is"
