    "requirements": [
      "1. Step Order Validation: Warn agents if they are working on a step before completing earlier steps in the plan",
      "2. Insert Step Action: New action that inserts a step and auto-increments all subsequent step indices",
      "3. Delete Step Action: Remove steps from plans",
      "4. Delete Plan Action: Remove entire plans",
      "5. Consolidate Actions: Combine/merge steps or plans",
      "6. Step Types System: Add typing to steps with backwards compatibility for old plans",
      "7. Step Type List (to refine): Update analysis, Plan Validation, User validation, Standard, Complex, Critical, Requires Immediate Validation, Fix, Build/Rebuild, Refactor, Archive, Confirmation"

    "constraints": [
      "Must be backwards compatible with existing plans that have no step types",
      "Step types should be optional - defaulting to 'standard' if not specified",
      "Step order validation should be a warning, not a blocker (some steps may legitimately be done out of order)",
      "Type system should be extensible for future types"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "User screenshot shows steps being marked done out of order (#5, #6, #7 done but #41 pending)",
