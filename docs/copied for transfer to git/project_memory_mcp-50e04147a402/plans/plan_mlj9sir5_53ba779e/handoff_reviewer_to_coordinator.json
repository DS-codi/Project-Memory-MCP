  "reason": "Phase 11 (Dynamic Prompt System) review APPROVED. All 10 criteria pass. Two low-severity advisories: (1) docs/dynamic-prompt-system.md documents version as 'number' but implementation correctly uses semver strings — doc should be updated. (2) memory_context.ts at 568 lines is past advisory threshold; future additions should consider splitting. Recommend Tester to write tests for prompt-writer.ts and prompt-storage.ts.",
