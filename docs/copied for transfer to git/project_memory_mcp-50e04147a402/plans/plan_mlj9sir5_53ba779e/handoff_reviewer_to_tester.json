Code follows existing patterns, Tailwind CSS consistent, all files under 300 lines, types properly defined, hooks follow React best practices, extension commands properly registered, route correctly added, Worker sessions visually distinct in timeline. One minor issue: unused import `formatRelative` in ProgramTreeView.tsx line 9 (should be removed, will cause lint warnings). Recommend Tester to write tests for this phase.",
