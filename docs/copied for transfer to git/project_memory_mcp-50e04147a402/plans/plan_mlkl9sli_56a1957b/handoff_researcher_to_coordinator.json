  "reason": "Research complete for step 40 (VS Code Terminal API and extension tool registration pattern). Comprehensive findings stored in research_notes/vscode-terminal-api-and-tool-registration.md covering: Terminal API (createTerminal, TerminalOptions, Shell Integration for output capture), tool registration pattern (package.json → ToolProvider.ts → tools/*.ts → McpBridge HTTP), gap analysis (memory_terminal/memory_filesystem declared in package.json but zero handler code), and design recommendation (HTTP proxy pattern for consistency). Note: Step 39 (test update in Server Terminal Hardening phase) is still pending and needs to be completed before phase confirmation. Recommend Executor to implement remaining extension terminal tool steps (41-44).",
