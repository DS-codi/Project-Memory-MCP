  "reason": "Research complete. Identified 5 root causes for interactive terminal visibility failure, with the primary cause being a CxxQt bridge definition mismatch between ffi.rs (used by CxxQtBuilder for C++ code generation, 10 invokables) and mod.rs (used by Rust compiler, 15 invokables). Secondary cause is missing Qt DLLs when building without the deploy script. Recommend Architect to design the fix approach and test strategy based on these findings.",
