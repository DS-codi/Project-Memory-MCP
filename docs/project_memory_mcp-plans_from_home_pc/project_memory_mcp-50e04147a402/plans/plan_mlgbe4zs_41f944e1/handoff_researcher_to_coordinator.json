  "reason": "Research complete for all 3 issues: (1) Cross-machine workspace context failure root cause identified — path-based identity validation rejects workspaces accessed from different mount points, while dashboard bypasses this. (2) Agent init overload analyzed — full PlanState with unbounded agent_sessions[], lineage[], and steps[] returned with no compact mode. (3) Workspace context usability gaps documented — VS Code /context command doesn't show context sections, section schema mismatch between dashboard and agents, no auto-injection or auto-population.
