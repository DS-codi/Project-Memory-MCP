  "description": "Update all agent files, instruction files, and skills to reflect the new interactive terminal GUI system. Update memory_terminal_interactive documentation across agent docs, mcp-usage.instructions.md, and the vscode-custom-tool-cloning skill. Create or update skills for the interactive terminal patterns. Ensure agents know when to use memory_terminal (headless/allowlist) vs memory_terminal_interactive (GUI approval).",

    "Close agent documentation coverage gaps by adding canonical terminal-surface guidance across the missing 10 of 15 agent files and normalizing the existing 5 files.",

    "Integrate Rust+QML interactive-terminal architecture guidance into relevant skills and product docs so tool decisions and GUI approval flow are consistently linked.",

  "success_criteria": [
    "All 15 agent docs contain role-appropriate terminal surface guidance with consistent terminology and no contradictory behavior claims.",
