      "Baseline and candidate are generated in same run by default; no canonical checked-in golden baseline path.",

      "Adopt versioned in-repo normalized golden baselines under src/test/replay/goldens/v1.",

      "Keep raw traces ephemeral and upload as CI artifacts; avoid checking raw JSONL into git."
