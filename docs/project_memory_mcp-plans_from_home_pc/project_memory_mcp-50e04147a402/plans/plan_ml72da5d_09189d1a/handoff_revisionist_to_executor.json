  "reason": "Analyzed final 3 test failures (88.9% pass rate). Root causes identified: 1) 'add new goal' test counts all textboxes but should check for separate newGoal input field, 2) mockUpdate test expects onUpdate callback but GoalsTab uses useMutation directly - test is invalid, 3) Path normalization issue where './/workspace' becomes '././/workspace' due to character doubling. Added 3 corrective steps (60-62) to plan for Executor to implement final fixes and achieve 100% test pass rate.",
