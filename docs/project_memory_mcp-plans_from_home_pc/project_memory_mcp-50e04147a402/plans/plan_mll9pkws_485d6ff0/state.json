  "description": "Extend the SkillWriter agent to handle cross-workspace instruction refactoring. When deployed to a foreign workspace, SkillWriter should analyze existing instruction/rule files and classify each as: (1) keep as instruction/rule (hard rules specific to that workspace), (2) convert to skill (reusable domain knowledge), or (3) delete/consolidate (redundant or outdated). Must follow the established skills-vs-instructions convention. Agent needs new workflow modes, classification heuristics, and user confirmation gates before making changes.",

Key difference: instructions = operational rules, skills = domain knowledge.\\n\\n3. **Classification Heuristics**: Built decision tree from established convention-skills-vs-instructions knowledge file. Signals for keep/convert/delete/protected categories. Conservative default: keep as instruction.\\n\\n4. **Cross-Workspace Deployment**: Documented memory_agent deploy mechanism. Identified dual-workspace pattern: plan data stays in PM workspace, file operations happen in foreign workspace. SkillWriter needs both workspace_id and foreign workspace_path.\\n\\n5. **Confirmation Flow**: Existing PM gates include plan-level confirm, step requires_user_confirmation, user_validation step type.
