# Research: Classification Heuristics — Rules vs Skills\n\n## Established Convention (knowledge file: convention-skills-vs-instructions)\n\n### Skills (`skills/`)\n- **User-facing domain knowledge** — language/framework expertise applicable across workspaces\n- Framework patterns (React, PySide6)\n- Language idioms\n- Architecture patterns (MVC, MVVM)\n- External API usage\n- Build system knowledge\n\n### Instructions (`instructions/`)\n- **PM-internal operational rules** — hard rules about how agents use tools, categorize requests, run analysis\n- MCP tool usage guides\n- Agent behavioral rules\n- Coordinator categorization logic\n- Analyst methodology\n- Workflow protocols\n\n## Proposed Classification Heuristics for SkillWriter\n\n### Signal: KEEP AS INSTRUCTION (do not convert)\n1. **Contains workspace-specific paths, IDs, or configuration** — References specific directories, filenames, or workspace structure\n2. **Defines agent behavioral constraints** — Rules about what agents can/cannot do\n3. **References MCP tools or PM-specific actions** — Instructions about how to use `memory_plan`, `memory_steps`, etc.\n4. **Contains workflow protocols** — Handoff sequences, validation gates, categorization logic\n5. **Has `applyTo` scoping to specific agent files** — Already scoped to PM-internal usage\n6. **Contains security boundaries or access rules** — Must remain as enforceable rules\n7. **Is a \"not for you\" / backup / exclusion rule** — Workspace-internal boundary\n\n### Signal: CONVERT TO SKILL\n1. **Teaches a technology pattern** — \"Here's how to use React hooks in this project\" → Skill\n2. **Documents reusable architecture decisions** — MVC patterns, component structure → Skill\n3. **Contains code examples with language-specific patterns** — Concrete code snippets → Skill\n4. **Is framework/library-specific** — PySide6, Express.js, Docker best practices → Skill  \n5. **Would be useful in OTHER workspaces using the same tech** — Portability test\n6. **Describes \"what to know\" not \"what to do\"** — Knowledge vs commands\n\n### Signal: DELETE/CONSOLIDATE\n1. **Duplicated content** — Same information in multiple files\n2. **Outdated/deprecated** — References removed features, old APIs\n3. **Subsumed by a skill** — Content already captured in an existing skill\n4. **Empty or placeholder** — No actionable content\n5. **Contradicts current rules** — Conflicts with established conventions\n\n### Signal: MUST NOT TOUCH (Protected)\n1. **Agent definition files** (`*.agent.md`) — SkillWriter cannot modify these\n2. **Security-related instructions** — Must remain as-is\n3. **Core system instructions** (e.g., `project-memory-system.instructions.md`) — Foundational\n4. **Files explicitly marked as protected** — Via convention or markers\n\n## Classification Decision Tree\n```\nInput: An instruction/rule file\n│\n├─ Is it a PM-internal operational rule? (references MCP tools, agent behavior)\n│  └─ YES → KEEP AS INSTRUCTION\n│\n├─ Does it teach domain knowledge? (framework, language, architecture)\n│  └─ YES → Is it already in a skill file?\n│     ├─ YES → CONSOLIDATE (merge into existing skill, delete instruction)\n│     └─ NO → CONVERT TO SKILL\n│\n├─ Is it workspace-specific? (paths, configs, IDs)\n│  └─ YES → KEEP AS INSTRUCTION\n│\n├─ Is it duplicated/outdated?\n│  └─ YES → DELETE (after confirming with user)\n│\n└─ Default → KEEP AS INSTRUCTION (conservative default)\n```\n\n## Critical Safeguard\nSkillWriter MUST present the full classification to the user for confirmation BEFORE executing any changes. This is not optional — it's a requirement from the original request."
