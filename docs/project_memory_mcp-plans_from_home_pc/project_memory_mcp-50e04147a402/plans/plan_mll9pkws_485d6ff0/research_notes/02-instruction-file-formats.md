# Research: Instruction File Formats & Conventions\n\n## Two Instruction Locations\n\n### 1. `.github/instructions/` (GitHub Copilot format)\n- Used by VS Code / GitHub Copilot for automatic instruction injection\n- Files in the **consuming workspace** (the one being worked on)\n- Currently 5 files in PM workspace's `.github/instructions/`:\n  - `avoid-monolithic-files.instructions.md`\n  - `handoff-protocol.instructions.md`\n  - `monolith-refactor.instructions.md`\n  - `not-for-you.instructions.md`\n  - `project-memory-system.instructions.md`\n- Format: standard markdown with optional frontmatter (`applyTo` field)\n\n### 2. `instructions/` (PM-internal operational rules)\n- Located in the PM source repository (Project-Memory-MCP/instructions/)\n- 25 instruction files covering MCP tool usage, agent operations, workflow protocols\n- Format: markdown with frontmatter (`applyTo` field specifying which agents/files they apply to)\n- These are PM's own operational documentation, NOT templates for other workspaces\n\n## Instruction File Format\n```markdown\n---\napplyTo: \"**/*\"   (or specific agent file like \"agents/coordinator.agent.md\")\n---\n\n# Title\n\n## Section\nContent...\n```\n\n### Key `applyTo` Patterns Found:\n- `\"**/*\"` — Applies to all files (general rules)\n- `\"agents/coordinator.agent.md\"` — Applies to specific agent file\n- `\"agents/analyst.agent.md\"` — Agent-specific operations\n\n## Skill File Format (`.github/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`)\n```markdown\n---\nname: skill-name-kebab-case\ndescription: >-\n  Use this skill when [trigger conditions].\ncategory: architecture|testing|deployment|frontend|backend|database|devops|security\ntags: [tag1, tag2]\nlanguage_targets: [typescript, python]\nframework_targets: [react, pyside6]\n---\n\n# Skill Name\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n## Key Patterns\n## Common Pitfalls\n## File Structure\n## Examples\n```\n\n## Key Differences: Instructions vs Skills\n\n| Aspect | Instructions (`.instructions.md`) | Skills (`SKILL.md`) |\n|--------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Location | `instructions/` or `.github/instructions/` | `.github/skills/{name}/` |\n| Frontmatter | `applyTo` (scope) | `name`, `description`, `category`, `tags`, `language_targets`, `framework_targets` |\n| Content | Operational rules, tool usage, workflows | Domain knowledge, patterns, examples |\n| Audience | Agents (how to behave) | Agents (what to know about a domain) |\n| Portability | Workspace-specific (mostly) | Cross-workspace (reusable) |\n| Deployment | Via `memory_agent(action: deploy, include_instructions: true)` | Via `memory_agent(action: deploy, include_skills: true)` |\n\n## Implications for SkillWriter Refactoring\n- When analyzing a foreign workspace, SkillWriter needs to look in:\n  - `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`\n  - `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` (existing skills)\n  - Any other custom locations (e.g., `docs/`, `rules/`, custom folders)\n- SkillWriter must understand both formats to convert between them\n- Some instruction files have `applyTo` scoping that must be preserved if kept as instructions"
