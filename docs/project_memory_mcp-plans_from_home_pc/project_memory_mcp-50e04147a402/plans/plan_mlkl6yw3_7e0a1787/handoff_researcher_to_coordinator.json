    "recommendation": "Executor",
    "research_summary": "Fully audited builder.agent.md (345 lines, 12+ sections) and reviewer.agent.md (145 lines, 16 sections). Builder has 7 unique capabilities to merge: dual-mode operation, regression detection, final verification with user-facing reports, build script CRUD, error diagnosis, terminal-first execution, structured handoff data. Reviewer has 8 integration points identified. Cross-reference updates needed in 5 agent files (executor, coordinator, tdd-driver, builder itself) and 3 instruction files (handoff-protocol, project-memory-system, build-scripts). Line counts for extraction targets: coordinator=1388, analyst=761, runner=408. Estimated post-merge Reviewer size: 250-300 lines (within threshold). Research notes saved as builder-reviewer-audit."
